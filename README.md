Vending Machine Simulator
Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Vending Machine Simulator implemented in SystemVerilog. The project aims to demonstrate the functionality of a simple vending machine that accepts different coin denominations, dispenses rotten tomatoes, provides change, and displays the current state and amount of change on 7-segment displays.

Features
Accepts Farthing (0.25d), Ha'penny (0.5d), and Penny (1d) coins.
Implements a finite state machine (FSM) for state management.
Dispenses rotten tomatoes as a humorous output.
Provides change in the form of farthings and ha'pennies.
Utilizes 7-segment displays for clear user feedback.
Includes detailed documentation explaining the design and implementation.
